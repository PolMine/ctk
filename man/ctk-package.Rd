Tools for importing XML into the CWB
}
\details{
The ctk-package relies on some external tools, such as the TreeTagger. The package gets
the information on the location of these tools from environment variables that
can be set in the .Renviron file in the home directory of a user.
The .Renviron file might might contain the following lines:
PATH_SAXON='/opt/saxon/saxon9he.jar'
PATH_TREETAGGER='/opt/treetagger'

The saxon XSLT parser ist available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/
For the TreeTagger, see: http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/
